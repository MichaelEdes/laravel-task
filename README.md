Hi James,

Welcome to the laravel task repo, I hope it satisfies everything you were after, it did take a bit of time trying to figure out how to use Inertia before as I'd never used it however I can totally understand why you use it, it made the whole process so much more streamlined.

As requested, I have created 2 models (product and category) and associated databases, aswell as controllers that handle the requests and responses, which also carry out the model validation, I really found Inertias in-built error handling useful, made the whole client-side validation process easier when it came to retreiving and displaying errors.

I really hope this is up to scratch, I have tried to use as much best practice as possible in order to achieve the desired outcome, with more time id carry out more testing and perhaps refine some areas on the client side but I think Ive tested it enough where functionality will not be an issue, also accounting for handling of erroneous cases.

I have also sent over the database via email that should already contain the categories aswell as a handful of products. Please let me know what you think and I'd appreciate any advice and feedback you may have!

To Start:
